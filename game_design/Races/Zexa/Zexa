Shroud spreads from buildings.
Shroud is needed to place a building.

The building process of a structure is in Four phases:
1: You select a building and then decides where it goes.
2: The hive starts producing a worm-like creature (Takes... Lets say 5 seconds)
3: The worm-like creature starts moving to the building location (The worm-like creature can be killed in this state and it can only move on shroud).
4: The worm-like creature then starts morphing into the building.
